# Image Thresholding and Unsupervised Segmentation

## Overview

This repository extends the functionality to include image thresholding and unsupervised segmentation tasks. **All implementations are done from scratch**.

## A) Image Thresholding

### Grayscale Images

For the supplied grayscale images, thresholding is performed using the following methods:
- Optimal Thresholding
- Otsu Thresholding
- Spectral Thresholding (more than 2 modes)
- Local Thresholding

## B) Unsupervised Segmentation

### Gray/Color Images

Unsupervised segmentation is carried out using the following methods:
- K-Means
- Region Growing
- Agglomerative
- Mean Shift
